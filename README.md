### Amazon Managed Blockchain deployment

This quick start automatically deploys an Amazon Managed Blockchain network in about thirty minutes. It is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, DevOps professionals, Chaincode developers, or business users who are planning to implement a Hyperledger Fabric node deployment on Amazon Managed Blockchain and deploy a decentralized application (dapp) on the AWS Cloud.

The Quick Start automates deploying an Amazon Managed Blockchain network along with the first blockchain member and its highly-available peer nodes. Review [our backlog](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-aws-amb-fabric/issues) for planned improvements or known issues.


For architectural details and step-by-step instructions, see the deployment guide.
