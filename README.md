### Amazon Managed Blockchain deployment

This quick start automatically deploys an Amazon Managed Blockchain network in a new or existing virtual private cloud (VPC) in about thirty minutes. Member peers for the first member are also created.

This Quick Start is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, DevOps professionals, Chaincode developers, or business users who are planning to implement a Hyperledger Fabric node deployment on Amazon Managed Blockchain and deploy a decentralized application (dapp) on the AWS Cloud.

The Quick Start automates the following:
* Deploying Amazon Managed Blockchain into a new or existing VPC
* Inviting other AWS accounts to join the network (optional)
* Deploying an example dapp containing chaincode, lambda-based fabric client methods, web APIs and a user interface, which a dapp developer can easily adapt to their needs. (optional)
